# Kenza | Agentic Systems & Data Architect

> **Engineering the lifecycle of autonomous intelligence.** > I build the data foundations (Engineering), the analytical brains (Science), and the autonomous actors (Agentic AI) that drive modern innovation.

###  The "Data-to-Agent" Pipeline
I view technology as a vertical stack where every layer feeds the next. My work focuses on making this transition seamless:

* **Layer 1: Data Engineering**  
    Building the "sensory system." I design robust pipelines that ingest, clean, and govern the high-quality data required for reliable AI.
* **Layer 2: Data Science & AI**   
    Developing the "cognitive engine." I translate raw data into predictive insights and fine-tuned models that understand complex patterns.
* **Layer 3: Agentic AI**   
    Deploying the "autonomous actor." I build multi-agent systems that don't just answer questions—they reason, use tools, and execute multi-step workflows.

###  Recent Focus: "Self-Healing Pipelines"
I am currently experimenting with **Agentic Data Engineering**, where AI agents monitor data quality in real-time and autonomously suggest (or apply) fixes to schema drifts and pipeline failures.

### Let's Collaborate
I’m looking to connect with teams building **autonomous agents**, **decentralized data meshes**, or **real-time AI infrastructure**.
